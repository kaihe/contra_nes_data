"""Stateful action mask — forbid structurally meaningless presses at sample time.

Reads the player's RAM state plus the previously committed action and returns,
for each action in a table, whether pressing it could change the game at all.
The Monte-Carlo sampler (``agent.sampler.ActionSampler.rollout``) restricts
itself to that legal set, so an inert press is never generated in the first
place — no post-hoc pruning pass needed.

What the disassembly says (reference/nes-contra-us):

* Jump (A) — ``bank7.asm`` ``@player_jump_check`` → ``set_jump_status_and_y_velocity``.
  A only starts a jump when the player is grounded and idle:
    - ``PLAYER_JUMP_STATUS ($A0) == 0``   (not already jumping)
    - ``EDGE_FALL_CODE     ($A4) == 0``   (not falling off a ledge)
    - ``ELECTROCUTED_TIMER ($C8) == 0``   (input frozen while electrocuted)
    - ``PLAYER_WATER_STATE ($B2) == 0``   (no jumping in water)
  and it is read from CONTROLLER_STATE_DIFF, i.e. only on the 0→1 press edge, so
  a held A (``prev_action[A] == 1``) does nothing.

* Fire (B) — ``check_player_fire`` (``bank6.asm:290``). Standard / F / S (spread)
  weapons read B from CONTROLLER_STATE_DIFF (``bank6.asm:319``): a held B fires
  nothing, you must release and re-press. M ($01) and L ($04) fire while held
  (``CONTROLLER_STATE``, line 314). Firing is also blocked while hidden or
  electrocuted, and you cannot shoot downward in water.

Every level table carries the bit-cleared twin of each fire/jump action
(``R``↔``RJ``/``RF``, ``_``↔``J``/``F`` …) and the no-op ``_`` is always legal,
so masking the inert-bit actions never empties the legal set — the searcher just
uses the canonical twin.

Bit order: ``[B, NULL, SELECT, START, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, A]`` — B=fire(0), A=jump(8).
