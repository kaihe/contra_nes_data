"""Shared action-space + frame-skip config for mc_search and PPO.

Single source of truth for the two things that must agree between the
Monte-Carlo searcher (``synthetic/mc_search.py``) and the trained policy
(``ppo/contra_wrapper.py``):

  * the discrete set of NES actions (a flat list of button vectors), and
  * the frame ``skip`` (how many NES frames one decision is held for).

If these diverge, a win path discovered by search is not reproducible by the
policy (different reachable states), which is exactly the bug this module
exists to prevent. Both consumers import :data:`DEFAULT` from here.

Each action is a length-9 NES button vector in bit order
``[B, NULL, SELECT, START, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, A]``. The action space is a
plain ``Discrete(num_actions)``: the agent picks an index, and the vector at
that index is the buttons held for ``skip`` frames.

Config values live in YAML beside this module (``<name>.yaml``); this module
only holds the dataclass and the loader. :data:`DEFAULT` is loaded from
``baseline.yaml``.

Note: ``contra/inputs.py`` keeps a separate, legacy two-head encoding still
used by the bigram builder / pixel2play / annotator. This module is the
canonical config for the mc_search<->PPO loop only.
